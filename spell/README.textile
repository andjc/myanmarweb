h1. Spell checking files

Hunspell files for Burmese developed by Keith Stribley (ThanLwinSoft) as part of a Myanmar line breaking and spellchecking extension for OpenOffice.org. (https://github.com/thanlwinsoft/myoooext).

The openoffice extension used a combination of a Myanmar Syllable algorithm and a spellcheck dictionary to identify Myanmar words within a paragraph of text even if there are no spaces between the words. This information is then use to line break without needing a space and for spell-checking.

The word list was derived from Dr Judson's Myanmar-Engish dictionary, which was last revised in 1918, so some updates have been made to spellings. There will also be new words which have entered the Myanmar language since then.

The intention is to develop the spellchecker as a Firefox extension and to implement it as a javascript based spellchecker.

If you find common Myanmar words, which are being wrongly identified by this extension please report the issue at https://github.com/enabling-languages/myanmarweb/issues
